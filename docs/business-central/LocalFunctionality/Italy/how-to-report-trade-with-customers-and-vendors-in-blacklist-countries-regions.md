# Report Trade with Customers and Vendors in Blacklist Countries-Regions
You must submit a periodic report of transactions with customers and vendors in certain countries/regions that the Italian government has identified in a blacklist. The blacklist communication report must be submitted to the Italian Revenue Agency to help prevent VAT fraud. Transactions that are subject to blacklist reporting include the following:  

- Purchases of goods or services  
- Sales of goods or services  

On a monthly or quarterly basis, you must generate the blacklist communication report for transactions with countries/regions that have privileged taxation and send it to the Italian Revenue Agency. The Italian Revenue Agency decides which countries/regions are included on the blacklist. You can view or change countries/regions on the blacklist by using the **Countries/Regions** window. The periodic report includes only transactions that have an amount above a certain threshold. The threshold amount calculation is applied at the document level. For more information, see the [Italian Revenue Agency](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=396483).  

Before you can submit the periodic report, you must set up [!INCLUDE[d365fin](../../includes/d365fin_md.md)].  

## To update the relevant countries/regions  

1.  Choose the ![Search for Page or Report](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Search for Page or Report icon") icon, enter **Countries/Regions**, and then choose the related link.  
2.  Choose the relevant country/region, and then select the **Blacklisted** check box.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    >  You may not be able to see the **Blacklisted** field. In that case, you must add it to the view.  

3.  Enter the **Foreign Country/Region Code** for the blacklisted country/region.  

For a list of relevant countries/regions and codes, see the [Italian Revenue Agency](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=206524).  

## To specify the current threshold amount  

1.  Choose the ![Search for Page or Report](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Search for Page or Report icon") icon, enter **VAT Posting Setup**, and then choose the related link.  
2.  In the **VAT Posting Setup** window, choose the **Blacklist Comm. Amount** action.  
3.  In the **Blacklist Comm. Amounts** window, fill in the fields as described in the following table.

## Creating the List of Transactions  
Depending on the size and type of company, you must generate and submit a report of transactions with vendors in blacklisted countries/regions on a monthly or quarterly basis. A suggested mapping of transactions to [!INCLUDE[d365fin](../../includes/d365fin_md.md)] accounts is provided in the following procedure, based on Spesometro 2013.
