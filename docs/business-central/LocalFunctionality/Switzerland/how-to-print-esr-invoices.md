# Print ESR Invoices
You can print an Einzahlungsschein mit Referenznummer (ESR) payment slip in the following ways:  

- As part of the sales invoice ESR.  
- As a separate document called an ESR coupon.  

The sales invoice ESR report corresponds with the sales invoice that is accompanied by an additional ESR coupon. By using the sales ESR coupon report, you can print the blue deposit slip.  

> [!NOTE]  
>  You must select a printer and select settings during the ESR payment module installation to print the deposit slip correctly. For more information, see the Printer Selection table.  

The following procedure describes how to print ESR sales invoices, but the same steps also apply for printing ESR coupons.  

## To print ESR invoices  

1.  Choose the ![Search for Page or Report](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Search for Page or Report icon") icon, enter **Invoice ESR**, and then choose the related link.  
2.  In the **Sales Invoice ESR** batch job, on the **Options** FastTab, fill in the fields as described in the following table.
