# Import Swiss Post Codes
You can import the latest post code file and use it to update the **Post Code** table. The post code file can be downloaded from the [Swiss Post](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=150292) website. After importing the latest post code, you can define post codes for customers or vendors. For more information, see [Register New Vendors](../../purchasing-how-register-new-vendors.md).  

## To import post codes  

1.  Choose the ![Search for Page or Report](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Search for Page or Report icon") icon, enter **Post Codes**, and then choose the related link.  
2.  Choose the **Import Post Codes** action.  
3.  In the **Import Post Codes** window, in the **Filename** field, enter the name of the post code file that you want to import to the **Post Code** table.  
4.  Choose the **OK** button.  

    The latest post code information is imported.  

The following procedure describes how to define post codes for customers, but the same steps also apply to defining post codes for vendors.  

## To define post codes for customers  

1.  Choose the ![Search for Page or Report](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Search for Page or Report icon") icon, enter **Customers**, and then choose the related link.  
2.  Select the customer for whom you want to define a post code, and then choose the **Edit** action.  
3.  In the **Customer Card** window, on the **General** FastTab, in the **Post Code** field, select the post code for the customer's address.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    >  When you select the post code, the **City** and **Country/Region Code** fields populate automatically with the information from the **Post Code** table. For more information, see [Register New Customers](../../sales-how-register-new-customers.md).  

4.  Choose the **OK** button.
