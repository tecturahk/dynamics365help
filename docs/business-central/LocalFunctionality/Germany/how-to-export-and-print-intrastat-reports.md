# Export and Print Intrastat Reports
Intrastat reporting is required throughout the European Union (EU) and must follow local requirements, such as specific formats and files. All companies in the EU must report their trade with other EU countries. The movement of goods must be reported to the statistics authorities (Statistisches Bundesamt) every month, and a report must be delivered to the tax authorities.  

 For Intrastat reporting, you must provide paper reports and files, which must be in ASCII format for Germany. [!INCLUDE[d365fin](../../includes/d365fin_md.md)] includes reports and batch jobs that generate all of the information that must be sent to the German tax authorities. This information automatically includes both receipt and delivery of goods. The Intrastat file contains information from the lines in the **Intrastat** journal.  

## To print the German Intrastat checklist  

1.  Choose the ![Search for Page or Report](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Search for Page or Report icon") icon, enter **Intrastat Journals**, and then choose the related link.  
2.  In the **Batch Name** field, select the required journal batch name.
3.  Choose the **Checklist Report** action.  
4.  In the **Intrastat - Checklist DE** window, on the **Options** FastTab, select the **Show Intrastat Journal Lines** check box.  

    > [!IMPORTANT]  
    >  If you clear the **Show Intrastat Journal Lines** check box, the report displays only the information that must be reported to the tax authorities, and not the lines in the journal.  

5.  Optionally, on the **Intrastat Jnl. Batch** FastTab, select the appropriate filters.  
6.  Optionally, on the **Intrastat Jnl. Line** FastTab, select the appropriate filters.  
7.  Choose the **Print** button to print the Intrastat checklist or choose the **Preview** button to view it on the screen.  

## To print the German Intrastat form  

1.  Choose the ![Search for Page or Report](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Search for Page or Report icon") icon, enter **Intrastat Journals**, and then choose the related link.  
2.  In the **Batch Name** field, select the required journal batch name.  
3.  Choose the **Form** action.  
4.  Optionally, on the **Intrastat Jnl. Batch** FastTab, select the appropriate filters.  
5.  Optionally, on the **Intrastat Jnl. Line** FastTab, select the appropriate filters.  
6.  Choose the **Print** button to print the Intrastat checklist or choose the **Preview** button to view it on the screen.  

## To export Intrastat information to a disk  

1.  Choose the ![Search for Page or Report](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Search for Page or Report icon") icon, enter **Intrastat Journals**, and then choose the related link.  
2.  In the **Batch Name** field, select the required journal batch name.  
3.  Choose the **Make Diskette** action.  
4.  On the **Options** FastTab, in the **Path** field, enter the full path and the name of the file to which you want to write the information.  

    Optionally, on the **Intrastat Jnl. Batch** FastTab, select the appropriate filters.  

5.  To export the file, choose the **OK** button.  

The Intrastat information is exported, and you can either save the data to a file, or you can open the file in the appropriate program.  

 When the file is exported, the **Reported** check box in the **Intrastat Jnl. Batches** window will be selected, and the **Internal Ref. No.** field on every entry in the journal will be filled in. You can manually change the contents of the field. For example, you can make changes when you need to run the report again. For more information, see Intrastat Jnl. Batch.
