# Post Physical Inventory Orders
After completing a physical inventory order and changing its status to **Finished**, you can post it.  

You can set the status of a physical inventory order to **Finished** if the following is true:  

- All related physical inventory recordings have a status of **Finished**.  
- Each physical inventory order line has been counted by at least one inventory recording line.  
- The **In Recording Lines** and the **Qty. Exp. Calculated** check boxes have been selected for all of the physical inventory order lines.  

After posting the order, you can view the posted physical inventory orders. Posted inventory documents provide a complete overview of the physical inventory process.
