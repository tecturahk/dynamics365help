1.  Choose the ![Search for Page or Report](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Search for Page or Report icon") icon, enter **Company Information**, and then choose the related link.  
2.  In the **Company Information** window, on the **General** FastTab, in the **VAT Representative** field, enter the contact person for VAT related information.  
3.  On the **Tax Office** FastTab, fill in the fields as described in the following table.  

    |Field|Description|

    |**Use Proxy Server**|Select to use a proxy server for communication.|  
    |**Proxy Server Authent.

4.  On the **HTTP Servers** FastTab, fill in the fields as described in the following table.

    |**HTTP Server URL 1**|Specifies a server of the Oberfinanzdirektion (OFD), such as **https://datenannahme1.elster.de/Elster2/EMS**.|
