# Error Messages of the ElsterTransferHandler
When [!INCLUDE[d365fin](../../includes/d365fin_md.md)] submits sales VAT advance notifications, errors can occur.  

For example, if the configuration file for the Microsoft.Dynamics.ElsterTransferHandler.dll assembly does not contain the correct friendly name of the public certificate, the ELSTER portal returns error 3400, and [!INCLUDE[d365fin](../../includes/d365fin_md.md)] displays the corresponding error message.  

## Error Messages  
The following table lists the error messages that the ELSTER portal sends to [!INCLUDE[d365fin](../../includes/d365fin_md.md)].
