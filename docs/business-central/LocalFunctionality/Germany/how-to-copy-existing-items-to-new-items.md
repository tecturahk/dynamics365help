# Copy Existing Items to New Items
You can group items with similar settings in an item catalog. When you add a new item, to save time, you can use the **Copy Item** function to copy an existing item to use as a template for a new item.  

## To copy existing items to new items  

1.  Choose the ![Search for Page or Report](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Search for Page or Report icon") icon, enter **Items**, and then choose the related link.  
2.  Select the item that you want to copy, and then choose the **Copy Item** action.  
3.  In the **Item Copy** window, fill in the fields as described in the following table.  

    |Field|Description|
