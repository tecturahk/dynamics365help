1.  Choose the ![Search for Page or Report](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Search for Page or Report icon") icon, enter **Payment Terms**, and then choose the related link.  
2.  Select the line with the payment term for which you want to activate or deactivate payment discounts.  
3.  Select the **Disreg. Pmt. Disc. at Full Pmt** check box to initiate activation for this feature. To deactivate, clear the check box.
