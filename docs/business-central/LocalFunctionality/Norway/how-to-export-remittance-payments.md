# Export Remittance Payments
You can use the export remittance payments process to export the payments file to your computer. You can then transfer the remittance payments to the bank.  

> [!IMPORTANT]  
>  Before you can export a remittance payment, you must select a payment format in the **Payment Export Format** field in the **Bank Account Card** window.  

You export payments to a bank file by choosing the **Export Payments** button in the **Payment Journal** window. The process may be different, depending on the export format that you select:  

- Payments using the SEPA payment standard are directly exported to a file when you choose the **Export Payments** button. For more information, see [Making Payments](../../payables-make-payments.md).  

- Payments using local payment standards, such as **Telepay**, are exported with either the **Remittance - export (bank)** or the **Remittance - export (BBS)** report, which automatically opens when you choose the **Export Payments** button.  

The procedure for exporting payments using the **Remittance â€“ Export** batch job is described in this topic.
