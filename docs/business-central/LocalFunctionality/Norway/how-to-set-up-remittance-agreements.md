# Set Up Remittance Agreements
You must sign an agreement of remittance with the bank when you set up electronic payments. You can create more than one remittance agreement if you have an agreement with two or more banks. For each agreement, you must specify one or more accounts from which the payment should be made. For each account, you must create a remittance account. For more information, see [Create Remittance Accounts](how-to-create-remittance-accounts.md).
