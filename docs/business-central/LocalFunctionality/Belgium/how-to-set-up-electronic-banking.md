# Set Up Electronic Banking
> [!Note]
> [!INCLUDE[onprem_only](../../includes/onprem_only_md.md)]

With electronic banking, you can make electronic payments to domestic, international, SEPA, and non-Euro SEPA vendors and customers.  

Your company subscribes to an eBanking contract with the bank to maintain a certain bank account or several bank accounts. The company also subscribes to Isabel to send payment files to and receive bank statement files from the bank electronically. Therefore, the company receives smartcards linked to the eBanking contract. The smartcards are secured by PIN codes.  

You will receive one of these smartcards to connect to IBS so that you are connected to the eBanking contract of the company.  

When uploading to or downloading files from the IBS platform, you will insert the smartcard in the card reader and use a PIN code to make connection to IBS. When the IBS session is established, the eBanking contract and eBanking user is known by the system. Also the eBanking contract and user linked bank account numbers are known.  

Before you can use electronic banking, you must set up the following information:  

- Electronic banking setup.  
- IBLC/BLWI codes - For more information, see [Set Up IBLC-BLWI Transaction Codes](how-to-set-up-iblc-blwi-transaction-codes.md).
