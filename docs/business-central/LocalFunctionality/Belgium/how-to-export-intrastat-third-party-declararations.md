1.  Choose the ![Search for Page or Report](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Search for Page or Report icon") icon, enter **Intrastat Journals**, and then choose the related link.  
2.  Choose the **Create File** action.  
3.  Fill in the fields as described in the following table.  

    |Field|Description|
