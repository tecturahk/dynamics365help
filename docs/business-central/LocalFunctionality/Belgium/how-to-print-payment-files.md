# Print Payment Files
After you have printed a test report and corrected all errors, you can print the payment journal lines to a payment file.  

A payment file contains either domestic, international, SEPA, or non-euro SEPA payments. The file can be sent to a bank either on disk, by modem, or via Interbanks Standards Association Belgium (Isabel). You can only create one file for each posting date and each currency code. When you export the payments to a file, an accompanying note is printed, which can also be sent to the bank.  

In the payment journal, the **Status** field on the exported lines will be set to **Posted**.  

## To print a payment file  

1.  Choose the ![Search for Page or Report](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Search for Page or Report icon") icon, enter **Payment Journal**, and then choose the related link.  
2.  On the **Options** FastTab, fill in the fields as described in the following table.  

    |Field|Description|  
    |---------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**Batch Name**|Specify the batch name of the payment journal.|  
    |**Bank Account**|Specify the bank account of the payment journal.|  
    |**Export Protocol**|Specify the export protocol code of the payment journal line. Export protocols control which payment file will be generated in the payment journal.<br /><br /> You can have a mixture of export formats in a single batch, such as domestic, international, SEPA, or a combination of these. However, when exporting the payment lines to a file, you can only use one export format, or export protocol. **Note:**  By defining the export protocol, you also define the type of validation that will be performed in the payment journal.|  

3.  Choose the **Check Payment Lines** action.

    The **Export Check Error Logs** window displays any errors that may exist. If there are errors, you must fix the errors before you can continue.

4. If there are no errors, choose the **Export Payment Lines** action.  

    The report that you specified in the **Test Report ID** field in the **EB Payment Journal Templates** will open.  

5.  Choose the **Print** button.
