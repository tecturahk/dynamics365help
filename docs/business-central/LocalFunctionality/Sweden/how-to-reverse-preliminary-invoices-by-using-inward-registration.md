# Reverse Preliminary Invoices by Using Inward Registration
Reverse an inward registration if you want to cancel it, for example, because you do not need the preliminary purchase invoice. For more information, see Inward Registration.  

## To reverse a preliminary invoice  

1.  Choose the ![Search for Page or Report](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Search for Page or Report icon") icon, enter **Purchase Invoices**, and then choose the related link.  
2.  Select an invoice that has been posted using inward registration.  
3.  Choose the **Inward Registration** action.  
4.  Choose the **Edit** action to open the **Inward Registration** window.  
5.  Choose the **Reverse** action.  
6.  Choose **Yes** to confirm that you want to reverse the inward registration.  

    The inward registration has been reversed and deleted. You can see the resulting negative entry in the **Inward Reg. Entry** window.
