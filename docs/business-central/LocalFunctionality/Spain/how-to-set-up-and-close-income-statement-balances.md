# Set Up and Close Income Statement Balances
You can use income statement balancing accounts to balance and track several accounts at the same time. The **Close Income Statement** batch job transfers income statement accounts to an account in the balance sheet, and closes the income statement accounts. When the **Close Income Statement** batch job is run, the entries are automatically posted.  

> [!NOTE]  
>  The fiscal year must be closed before the batch job can run.

1.  Choose the ![Search for Page or Report](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Search for Page or Report icon") icon, enter **Chart of Accounts**, and then choose the related link.
