You can export a VAT statement in XML format and then submit it electronically to the tax authorities.  

For more information, see the [Spanish Tax Agency](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=238181) website.  

## To export a VAT statement in XML format  

1.  Choose the ![Search for Page or Report](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Search for Page or Report icon") icon, enter **VAT Statement**, and then choose the appropriate link.  
2.  Select the required VAT statement, and then choose the **Generate XML file** action.  

    > [!IMPORTANT]  
    >  The VAT statement name must be of the template type **One Column Report**.  
    >   
    >  In the standard version of [!INCLUDE[d365fin](../../includes/d365fin_md.md)], the VAT statement name for the 392 telematic statement is of the type **One Column Report**.  

3.  In the **XML VAT Declaration** window, on the **Options** FastTab, fill in the fields as described in the following table.  
  
    |Field|Description|  
    |---------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**VAT entries included**|Specify if the VAT statement must include open entries, closed entries, or both open and closed entries.|  
    |**VAT entries included**|Specify if the VAT statement must include only entries from the period that is specified in the **Date Filter** field, or also entries from previous periods.|  
    |**Additional Currency**|Select to display the report amounts in the additional reporting currency.|  

4.  On the **VAT Statement Line** FastTab, specify a value for the **Date Filter** field.  

    Optionally, select additional filters.  
5.  Choose the **OK** button.  
6.  In the **XML Transference Format** window, verify that the VAT statement is set up as required, and then choose the **OK** button.  

You can open or save the generated XML file. You can now submit the VAT statement to the tax authorities.
