### To print a VAT reconciliation report  

1.  Choose the ![Search for Page or Report](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Search for Page or Report icon") icon, enter **VAT Reconciliation**, and then choose the related link.  
2.  On the **Options** FastTab, fill in the fields as described in the following table.  

    |Field|Description|  
    |---------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**Show Details**|Select to print all transaction amounts in the report.<br /><br /> If you do not select this field, a single cumulative line is printed for each general ledger account.|
