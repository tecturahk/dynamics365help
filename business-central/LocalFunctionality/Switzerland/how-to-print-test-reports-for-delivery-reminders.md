# Print Test Reports for Delivery Reminders
After you have created delivery reminders and made any needed modifications, you can either print the test reports or issue the delivery reminders.  

A test report is a document that lets you review and modify a delivery reminder before you issue it.  

## To print test reports before issuing delivery reminders  

1.  Choose the ![Search for Page or Report](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Search for Page or Report icon") icon, enter **Delivery Reminder**, and then choose the related link.  
2.  In the **Delivery Reminder List** window, choose the **Delivery Reminder - Test** action.  
3.  In the **Delivery Reminder - Test** window, set a filter if you want to print only selected delivery reminders.  
4.  Choose the **Print** to print the report or choose the **Preview** button to view it on the screen.
