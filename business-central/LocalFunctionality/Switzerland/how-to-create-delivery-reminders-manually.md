# Create Delivery Reminders Manually
In [!INCLUDE[d365fin](../../includes/d365fin_md.md)], you can create delivery reminders when a purchase has not been delivered as expected. You can create a single delivery reminder manually, or you can generate delivery reminders for all overdue deliveries. For more information, see [Generate Delivery Reminders](how-to-generate-delivery-reminders.md).

> [!NOTE]
> To create delivery reminders, you must set up the delivery reminder properties. For more information, see [Set Up Delivery Reminders](how-to-set-up-delivery-reminders.md).

1.  Choose the ![Search for Page or Report](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Search for Page or Report icon") icon, enter **Delivery Reminder**, and then choose the related link.  
2.  Choose the **New** action.  
3.  In the **Delivery Reminder** window, on the **General** FastTab, fill in the fields as described in the following table.

    |**No.**|The unique identification number for the delivery reminder.|

    |**Reminder Level**|The delivery reminder level. This value is based on the number of delivery reminders that have already been sent. For more information, see [Set Up Delivery Reminder Terms, Levels, and Text](how-to-set-up-delivery-reminder-terms-levels-and-text.md).|  
    |**Reminder Terms Code**|Specify the delivery reminder terms code that is set up for the vendor.|
