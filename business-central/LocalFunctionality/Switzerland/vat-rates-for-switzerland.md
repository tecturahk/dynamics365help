# VAT Rates for Switzerland
If VAT rates change, you must use the VAT rate change tool. In earlier versions of [!INCLUDE[d365fin](../../includes/d365fin_md.md)] you could temporarily use both the old and the new VAT rates for transactions, depending on the shipping dates. This functionality has been deprecated.  

For more information, see [Report VAT to Tax Authorities](../../finance-how-report-vat.md).
