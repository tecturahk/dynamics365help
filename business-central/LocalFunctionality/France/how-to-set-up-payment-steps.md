# Set Up Payment Steps
To use payment management, you must set up steps for payment documents and define payment steps for each payment status. For example, "Creation of documents," "Documents created,” and "Creation of payments." For more information, see [Set Up Payment Statuses](how-to-set-up-payment-statuses.md).  

## To set up payment steps  

1.  Choose the ![Search for Page or Report](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Search for Page or Report icon") icon, enter **Payment Slip Setup**, and then choose the relevant link.  
2.  Select a payment class, and then choose the **Steps** action.  
3.  In the **Name** field, enter a name for the payment step. You can enter a maximum of 50 alphanumeric characters.  
4.  Choose the **Edit** action.  
5.  In the **Payment Step Card** window, fill in the fields as described in the following table.
