# Set Up Accelerated Depreciation
To use the accelerated depreciation calculation, you must set up the following depreciation books for fixed assets:  

- The accounting depreciation book (integrated with the general ledger).  
- The tax depreciation book (not integrated with the general ledger).  

> [!NOTE]  
>  When you post an acquisition, depreciation, or disposal for the accounting depreciation book, the transaction is duplicated and posted in the tax depreciation book when the fixed asset journal is posted.  

## To set up the accounting depreciation book  

1.  Choose the ![Search for Page or Report](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Search for Page or Report icon") icon, enter **Depreciation Books**, and then choose the relevant link.  
2.  In the **Depreciation Book List** window, choose Â¨the **New** action.  
3.  On the **General** FastTab, fill in the required fields as described in the following table.  

    |Field|Description|

    |**Code**|The unique identification code for the accounting depreciation book. You can enter a maximum of 10 alphanumeric characters.|  
    |**Description**|The depreciation book description.|  

    > [!IMPORTANT]  
    >  Leave the **Derogatory Calculation** field blank.  

4.  On the **Integration** FastTab, select the **Derogatory** check box to integrate accelerated depreciation with the general ledger.  

    For more information, see [Set Up Fixed Asset Depreciation](../../fa-how-setup-depreciation.md).
