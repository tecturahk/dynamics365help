# Export or Import Payment Management Setup Parameters
You can export or import payment management setup parameters to an external disk so that you can use the same parameters for another company with similar requirements.  

You can use the following formats to export payment setup parameters:  

- ETEBAC (XMLport 10860) – To create a bill of exchange remittance.  
- Withdraw (XMLport 10861) – To create a customer payment withdrawal (direct debit).  
- Transfer (XMLport 10862) – To create a vendor payment transfer (credit transfer).  

You can select these formats when you set up the payment status for your payment class. For more information, see [Set Up Payment Classes](how-to-set-up-payment-classes.md).
