* Set up payment terms and item charges.  
* Set up customers for OIOUBL.  

### About OIOUBL Profiles  
OIOUBL profiles are adaptations of business processes for various types of transactions, and differ depending on the types and contents of the documents that are exchanged. In Denmark, the two profiles that are required are the **Simpel fakturaproces** (Procurement-OrdSim-BilSim-1.0) and **Billing Basic** (urn:www.nesubl.eu:profiles:profile5:ver2.0) profiles. The Billing Basic profile is based on the Northern European Subset (NES). Your customer must be able to receive documents in one of these profiles. If you are not sure, ask your customer about the profile they require. For more information, see the entry on OIOUBL profiles in the frequently asked questions section at [Digitaliseringsstyrelsen](https://aka.ms/Digitaliseringsstyrelsen).  

The default profile for all customers is the Simpel fakturaproces profile, which is chosen in the **Sales & Receivables Setup** window. You specify the profile for a specific customer on the **Customer** card. If you want to use the Billing Basic profile you will need to add it. To do so, in the **Sales & Receivables Setup** window, choose the button in the **Default Profile Code** field, and then choose **New**. Enter a name for the code, and then in the **Profile** field, enter **urn:www.nesubl.eu:profiles:profile5:ver2.0**. You can then choose the profile either as the default profile, or for one or more customers.

2.  In the **OIOXML Code** field, choose a code for each payment term that you will use for electronic invoices.
