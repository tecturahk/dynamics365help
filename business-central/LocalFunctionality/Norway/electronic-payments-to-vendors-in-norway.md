# Electronic Payments to Vendors in Norway
[!INCLUDE[d365fin](../../includes/d365fin_md.md)] includes Norwegian enhancements for automatically making payments to vendors. This reduces errors that occur from manual data entry. You can use this functionality to perform the following operations:  

- Search invoices that are due based on different conditions.  
- Send payments to the bank.  
- Receive messages from the bank on the status of payments.  
- Receive paid transaction information to be posted.  

You can make electronic payments using the following formats:  

- TelePay  
- Remittance payment  

## Electronic Payment Process  
The following steps show how electronic payments are processed:  

1.  The payment proposal is run in the electronic payments feature and transferred to the bank by using the bankâ€™s software.  
2.  The bank's software receives the payments and transfers payments to the bank.  
3.  The bank receives the payments and sends the first-time return receipt to [!INCLUDE[d365fin](../../includes/d365fin_md.md)] using the bank's software.  
4.  The bank executes the payments and sends the settlement return (second-time return receipt) to [!INCLUDE[d365fin](../../includes/d365fin_md.md)] using the bank's software where the payments are posted.  

## Vendor Payment Requirements  
If the payment transactions do not fulfill the requirements, an error message appears and you cannot create a payment file for transfers to the bank. The following criteria must be met when you process payments to vendors:  

- The payment transaction must be positive or zero. A payment transaction must transfer a positive amount (or zero) to the payment receiver. This means that deducting a credit memo requires an invoice with the same or higher amount in the same payment transaction. Money cannot be deducted from the vendor's account.  

- A credit memo must be applied with the invoice. Generally a credit memo does not contain a Kunde ID (KID). You cannot pay a credit memo in a payment transaction with invoices that contain a KID. This is because payments are usually split into transactions with or without a KID. This means that if a credit memo without a KID is paid with an invoice in the same payment transaction, the invoice must be paid without a KID, and the recipient reference number must be used instead.  

- If the invoice and credit memo are paid in the same payment transaction, the payment must occur on the same date using the same currency and exchange rate.
