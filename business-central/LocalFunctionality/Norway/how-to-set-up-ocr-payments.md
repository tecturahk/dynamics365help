# Set Up OCR Payments
You can process electronic payments from customers according to a predefined payment ID. This is often referred to as an optical character recognition (OCR) payment. The payment ID is used with electronic payment transactions. Customers can refer to this ID when they make payments. The payment ID is also used to identify imported payment transactions and automatically apply imported payment data.  

## To set up OCR payments  

1.  Choose the ![Search for Page or Report](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Search for Page or Report icon") icon, enter **OCR Setup**, and then choose the related link.  
2.  On the **General** FastTab, fill in the fields as described in the following table.  

    |Field|Description|

    |**Format**|Select an OCR payment file format. Formats include **BBS** and **Data Dialog**.|  
    |**FileName**|Enter the full path of the OCR payment file.|  
    |**Delete Return File**|Select to rename the file after import and prevent the file from being imported more than one time.|
