# Recurring Orders
You can use recurring orders to create blanket order templates so that sales orders can be created based on date intervals that you define. For example, if you deliver the same sales order every two weeks, you can use a blanket sales order and create recurring orders.  

You can use recurring groups to define a range of parameters that show how you make the orders. These groups are assigned to blanket orders that have to be created regularly. To create the recurring orders, you will have to periodically run the create recurring orders process. For more information see [Create Recurring Orders](how-to-create-recurring-orders.md).
