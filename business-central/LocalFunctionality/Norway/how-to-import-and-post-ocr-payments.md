Before you can receive optical character recognition (OCR) payments, you must make the following preparations:  

- Set up a cash receipt journal template to balance OCR transactions according to the document number, instead of the document type.  
- Import and post the OCR payment files to a cash receipt journal.  

## To import OCR payments

2.  In the **Batch Name** field, select a journal batch.  

    > [!NOTE]
