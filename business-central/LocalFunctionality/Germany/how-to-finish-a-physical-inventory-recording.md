# Finish a Physical Inventory Recording
After you have entered all data for a physical inventory recording, you can finish the recording by setting the **Status** field to **Finished**.  

You can only do this, if the **Recorded** field is selected for all physical inventory recording lines for the current physical inventory recording.  

## To finish a physical inventory recording  

1.  Choose the ![Search for Page or Report](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Search for Page or Report icon") icon, enter **Phys. Inventory Recording List**, and then choose the related link.  
2.  Open the physical inventory recording that you want to finish, and then choose the **Finish** action.  

    The status is set to **Finished**. You can no longer change the physical inventory header or the physical inventory lines.  

When you finish the current physical inventory recording, every physical inventory recording line is assigned to one line of the related physical inventory order. The physical inventory order lines are assigned with the same values in the **Item No.**, **Variant Code**, **Location Code**, and **Bin Code** fields as the physical inventory recording line has.  

If no such physical inventory order line exists, and if the **Recording without order permit** field is selected on the physical inventory recording header, a new line is inserted automatically and the **Recorded without Order** field on the physical inventory order line is selected. Otherwise, an error message is displayed and the process is canceled. If there are more than one such physical inventory order lines, an error message is displayed and the process is canceled.
