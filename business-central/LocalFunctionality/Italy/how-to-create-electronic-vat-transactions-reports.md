# Create Electronic VAT Transactions Reports
You must create a list of transactions that include VAT with amounts over the current threshold on or before the specified occurrence date. You submit this report to the tax authorities.  

## To create a VAT transactions report  

1.  Choose the ![Search for Page or Report](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Search for Page or Report icon") icon, enter **VAT Report**, and then choose the related link.  
2.  Fill in the fields as described in the following table.  

    |Field|Description|  
    |-------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**Without Contract**|The VAT entries that resulted in this line are not associated with a contract.|  
    |**Contract**|The VAT entries that resulted in this line are associated with a contract.|  
    |**Other**|The VAT entries that resulted in this line are not associated with a special contract, such as ongoing maintenance or other exceptions.|  

    > [!TIP]  
    >  In [!INCLUDE[d365fin](../../includes/d365fin_md.md)], the contract that the tax authorities are looking for can be blanket orders or service contracts. To identify if the VAT report line belongs to a blanket order or service contract, you can drill down to see the underlying VAT entries from the **Amount** field.  

Credit memos are included in the VAT transaction report if the customer or vendor is from a country/region that is outside the EU and not black-listed. For more information, see [Italian VAT](italian-vat.md).  

Now that you have created the VAT report, you must submit it to the tax authorities. For more information, see [Export VAT Transactions Reports](how-to-export-vat-transactions-reports.md).
