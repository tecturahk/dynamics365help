To evaluate profit and loss, a fiscal year closing report is provided at the end of each fiscal year.  

Fiscal year closing involves the following steps:

- Generating a year-end closing entry using the **Close Income Statement** option.  
- Posting the year-end closing entry.

2.  To close an accounting period, select the accounting period, and then choose the **Close Year** action.  
3.  To confirm that you want to close the fiscal year, choose the **Yes** button.
