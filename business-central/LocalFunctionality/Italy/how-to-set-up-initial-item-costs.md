# Set Up Initial Item Costs
When you set up [!INCLUDE[d365fin](../../includes/d365fin_md.md)] in your organization.  

In the **Before Start Item Cost** window, you can enter information about inventory items, such as component costs, routing costs, and overhead costs.  

## To set up initial item costs  

1.  Choose the ![Search for Page or Report](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Search for Page or Report icon") icon, enter **Before Start Item Cost**, and then choose the related link.  
2.  Choose the **New** action.  
3.  Enter information into the required fields. This includes the **Starting Date**, **Purchase Quantity**, **Purchase Amount**, **Production Quantity**, and **Production Amount** fields.
