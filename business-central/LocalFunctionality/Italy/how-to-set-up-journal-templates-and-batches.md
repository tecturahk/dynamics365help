# Set Up Journal Templates and Batches
All European Union (EU) companies must submit Intrastat reports to the customs office, detailing their trade with other EU countries/regions for the current year. An Intrastat summary report is presented to the tax authorities monthly, quarterly, or yearly depending upon the company's business.  

You can print Intrastat reports in the **Intrastat Jnl. Batches** window based on Intrastat journal entries. You can manually place entries into the journal, or use a batch job to place the entries there. Before you can do this, you must set up Intrastat journal templates and batches.
