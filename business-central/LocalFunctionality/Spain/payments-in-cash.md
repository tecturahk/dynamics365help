# Payments in Cash
As of January 1, 2012, companies in Spain are required to submit a summary for payments in cash that are greater than EUR 6.000.00 for each customer for each year.  

## Reporting Payments in Cash  
If you are reporting payments in cash, the following sequence of tasks are listed in the order in which they are generally performed:  

- Applying payments in cash to invoices.  
- Making 340 Payments in cash declaration.  

## Applying Payments in Cash to Invoices  
You apply payments in cash to invoices that you have received from customers. For information about how to apply payments to invoices, see [Managing Receivables](../../receivables-manage-receivables.md). Only the applied payments in cash are used for reporting payments in cash. If you do not apply payments in cash to invoices, you cannot report payments in cash.  

## Making 340 Payments in Cash Declaration  
You use the **Make 340 Declaration** batch job to report 340 payments in cash declaration. For information about how to specify and select information to generate the declaration, see Make 340 Declaration.  

> [!NOTE]  
>  The payments made through banks are excluded.  

> [!NOTE]  
>  The amount received in cash in the declaration .txt file can contain values that differ from the total invoiced amount for a customer. This is because not all of the payments are made in cash.
