# Create Report 347
All companies must provide an annual declaration, **Report 347**, to the tax authorities providing the sales and purchase transactions from the previous fiscal period.  

The Report 347 declaration is generated in a format that is approved by the tax authorities for upload to their Virtual Office website or submission on CD-ROM.  

Before you create the Report 347 declaration, you can run a report to identify payments in cash that have not been applied to a document.  

## To identify unapplied payments in cash  

1.  Choose the ![Search for Page or Report](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Search for Page or Report icon") icon, enter **347**, and then choose the link for the **347 Declaration** area.  
2.  Choose the **Unapplied Payments in Cash** action.  
3.  On the **Options** FastTab, fill in the fields.  

## To create a Report 347 declaration  

1.  Choose the ![Search for Page or Report](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Search for Page or Report icon") icon, enter **Make 347 Declaration**, and then choose the related link.  
2.  On the **Options** FastTab, fill in the fields. For more information, see Make 347 Declaration.  
3.  Choose the **OK** button.  

When you send the Report 347 declaration, you must include 347 declaration labels. The labels are required as part of the package for the tax authorities.  

## To create 347 declaration labels  

1.  Choose the ![Search for Page or Report](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Search for Page or Report icon") icon, enter **347 Declaration Labels**, and then choose the related link.
