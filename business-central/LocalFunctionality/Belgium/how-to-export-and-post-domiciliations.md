# Export and Post Domiciliations
> [!Note]
> [!INCLUDE[onprem_only](../../includes/onprem_only_md.md)]

You can submit domiciliations to your bank by exporting the data to a file. When you export to a file, you can choose to automatically post the lines to the general ledger.  

Depending on setup of the **SEPA Direct Debit Exp. Format** field in the **Bank Account Card** window, the **File Domiciliations** action opens either of these request pages:  

- **Create Gen. Jnl. Lines** window – for the SEPA Direct Debit format.  
- **File Domiciliations** window – for domestic formats.  

## To export and post domiciliations in SEPA format  

1.  Choose the ![Search for Page or Report](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Search for Page or Report icon") icon, enter **Domiciliation Journals**, and then choose the related link.  
2.  In the **Batch Name** field, select the required journal batch, and then choose the **File Domiciliations** action.  
3.  In the **Create Gen. Jnl. Lines** window, select the **Options** FastTab, and then fill in the fields as described in the following table.  

    |Field|Description|  
    |---------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**Journal Template Name**|Select the general journal template that the domiciliations will be posted from.|  
    |**Journal Batch**|Select the general journal batch that the journal lines will be transferred from.|  
    |**Post General Journal Lines**|Select to post to the general ledger.|  

4.  Choose the **OK** button to export the file.  
5.  Choose an appropriate location from where you upload the file to your bank, and then choose **Save**.  
6.  Choose the **Yes** button to automatically post the domiciliation journal lines.  

    If you did not select the **Post General Journal Lines** check box, you will have to post the domiciliations manually in the general journal.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    >  After you have posted domiciliations in the general journal, delete the posted domiciliations in the **Domiciliation Journal** window. To do this, select all lines with status **Posted**, and then choose the **Delete** button.
