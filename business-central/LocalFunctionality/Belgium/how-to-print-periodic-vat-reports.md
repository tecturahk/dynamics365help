# Print Periodic VAT Reports
The VAT reporting feature enables you to print VAT transaction details. You must send the following VAT reports to the Belgian tax authorities:  

- Monthly/Quarterly declaration

- VAT-VIES listing (on paper/disk)  

## To print the monthly/quarterly declaration

2.  In the **VAT – Form** window, fill in the fields.  

    |Field|Description|

    |**VAT Annual Listing**|Specifies if you want to print the **VAT Annual Listing** report.|  
    |**Year**|Enter the year of the period for which you want to print the report. You should enter the year as a 4 digit code. For example, to print a declaration for 2013, you should enter "2013" (instead of "13").|  
    |**Minimum Amount**|Enter the customer's minimum year balance to be included in the report. If the yearly balance of the customer is less than the minimum amount, the customer will not be included in the declaration.|  
    |**Include Customers From**|Select to include customers from all countries/regions or from a specific country/region in the report.|  
    |**Country/Region**|Select the country/region to include in the report.|  

3.  Choose the **Print** button to print the report or choose the **Preview** button to view it on the screen. Choose the **Cancel** button to save the information without printing the report.  

## To print the VAT annual listing on disk

2.  In the **VAT Annual Listing – Disk** window, fill in the fields as described in the following table.  

    |Field|Description|  
    |---------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**Year**|Enter the year of the VAT declaration. You should enter the year as a four digit code. For example, to print a declaration for 2013, you should enter "2013" (instead of "13").|  
    |**Minimum**|Enter the customer's minimum year balance to be included in the report.<br /><br /> If the yearly balance of the customer is less than the minimum amount, the customer will not be included in the declaration.|  
    |**Test Declaration**|Specifies if you want to create a test declaration.<br /><br /> If selected, an attribute test is written to the file that uses value 1, which indicates that this is a test file. If you want to test the XML file before sending it, you can upload this file to the Intervat site. The file is then validated without being stored on the server and you receive a notification if the file is valid. Also the unique sequence number in the XML file is not increased when a test declaration is created, which means that you can create as many internal test declarations as you want.|
