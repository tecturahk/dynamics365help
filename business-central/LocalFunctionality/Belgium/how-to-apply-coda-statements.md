# Apply CODA Statements
After a CODA statement has been imported, the statement lines can be accessed from the **Bank Account Card** window. The application status on each line will be blank because the statement amounts have not been applied to outstanding ledger entries.  

Statement amounts can be applied to outstanding ledger entries by:  

-   Manually applying CODA statement lines.  
-   Automatically applying CODA statement amounts to the appropriate ledger entries and accounts. Automatic processing of CODA statement lines is recommended.  

## To manually apply the CODA statement lines  

1.  Choose the ![Search for Page or Report](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Search for Page or Report icon") icon, enter **Bank Accounts**, and then choose the related link.  
2.  Select the bank account, and then choose the **CODA Statements** action.  
3.  Select the CODA statement, and then choose the **Edit** action.  
4.  In the **CODA Statement Lines** FastTab, for each statement line, fill in the fields as described in the following table.  

    |Field|Description|  
    |---------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**Account No.**|Enter the number of the general ledger account, bank, customer, vendor, or fixed asset, which the bank account statement line is linked to.|  
    |**Description**|[!INCLUDE[d365fin](../../includes/d365fin_md.md)] automatically retrieves the description from the imported CODA file, but you can modify the contents of this field.|  

5.  Choose the **OK** button.  

## To automatically apply the CODA statement lines  

1.  Choose the ![Search for Page or Report](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Search for Page or Report icon") icon, enter **Bank Accounts**, and then choose the related link.  
2.  Select the bank account, and then choose the **CODA Statements** action.  
3.  Select the CODA statement, and then choose the **Edit** action.  
4.  Choose the **Process CODA Statement Lines** action.  
5.  Fill in the fields as described in the following table.  

    |Field|Description|  
    |---------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**Default Posting**|Select if you want the batch job to post statement amounts that cannot be linked to existing ledger entries. For more information, see Transaction Coding.|  
    |**Print List**|Select to print a list of statement amounts that cannot be linked automatically.|  

6.  Choose the **OK** button.  

    When you start the batch job, statement amounts will be applied to existing ledger entries based on the transaction codes. For more information, see [Set Up Bank Accounts for CODA](how-to-set-up-bank-accounts-for-coda.md).
