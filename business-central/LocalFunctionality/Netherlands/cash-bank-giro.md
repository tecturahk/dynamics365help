# Cash-Bank-Giro
Cash/Bank/Giro helps you posting both cash and bank/giro transactions into the system in an easier and more direct way than using the General Journals.  

 Next to this and in conjunction with Telebanking, it allows you import electronic bank statements into the Bank/Giro Journals. If wanted the system can automatically reconcile these statements during this import process and determine whether a statement can be applied to open ledger entries for the relevant vendor/customer.
