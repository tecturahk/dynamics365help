# Create Proposals
Proposals can be generated manually or automatically based on either vendor or customer ledger entries.  

> [!IMPORTANT]  
>  To create a proposal, you must use the **Owner Information** field in the Vendor Bank Account Card and Customer Bank Account Card windows.  

> [!NOTE]  
>  At any time and at any level, before processing a proposal, the transaction mode and bank account can be modified. At the lowest level on the relevant vendor or customer ledger entries.  

## To create proposals manually  

1.  Choose the ![Search for Page or Report](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Search for Page or Report icon") icon, enter **Telebank - Bank Overview**, and then choose the related link.  
2.  Select the relevant bank account and then choose the **Proposal** action.  
3.  At a minimum, you must fill in the **Account Type**, **Account No.**, **Transaction Mode**, **Bank Account No.**, and **Amount** fields.  

4.  If you want to view or adjust the proposal's detail lines, choose the **Detail Information** action. To return to the proposal, close the **Proposal Detail Line** window.  

## To create proposals automatically from sales  

1. Set up a card for the customer who sent the invoice with appropriate values for the **Currency Code**, **Transaction Mode**, and **Bank Account** fields.  
2. Create a sales invoice or credit memo, enter the customer and relevant items and post the invoice.
3. Check whether the **Currency Code**, **Transaction Mode**, and **Bank Account** fields of the invoice/credit memo contain appropriate values. By default, they will be copied from the customer card.  

4.  Choose the ![Search for Page or Report](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Search for Page or Report icon") icon, enter **Telebank - Bank Overview**, and then choose the related link.  
5.  Select the relevant bank account, and then choose the **Proposal** action.  
6.  Choose the **Get Entries** action.  

    You can use the Get Proposal Entries Batch Job batch job to generate proposal lines based on relevant customer ledger entries.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    >  Only proposal lines will be created for ledger entries that have a transaction mode of account type **Customer** and a link to the active bank account.  

6.  If you want to view or adjust the proposal's detail lines, choose the **Detail Information** action. To return to the proposal, close the **Proposal Detail Line** window.
